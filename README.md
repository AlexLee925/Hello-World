Tutorial repository!

This is super nerve-wracking, but I think I'm getting the hang of it! Even though I'm not going into data science or CS, maybe this will be applicable when I'm doing research for grad school! I really want to go to Michigan State University for Industrial-Oragnizational Psychology.
